"""E2E integration tests for issue #1147: in-package relative link rewriting.

These tests invoke the real ``apm`` binary against fixture packages on
disk to prove the install pipeline rewrites in-package relative markdown
links to their ``apm_modules/`` location, AND that the resulting deploy
artifacts contain links that resolve on disk under the consumer's host
target layout.

Coverage matrix:

1. **Instruction -> sibling asset** (the original #1147 repro).
2. **Prompt -> sibling reference doc** (proves the fix is not
   instruction-specific; same primitive surface that broke after the
   ``.agents/.github`` split in #1103).
3. **Multiple links per file** (relative rewritten, ``https://``
   external preserved, ``#fragment`` only preserved).
4. **Path-traversal escape preserved** (security: a link that resolves
   outside the package root must NOT be rewritten and the file outside
   the package must not be exposed via ``apm_modules/``).
5. **Skill-bundle internal link unchanged** (regression guard: a link
   inside a skill bundle, where the layout is preserved, must remain a
   normal in-bundle relative link, not be rewritten through
   ``apm_modules/`` unnecessarily breaking it).
6. **Multi-target install** (Copilot + Claude in one run): both
   deployed copies of the instruction get their links rewritten and
   both rewritten links resolve on disk.

All tests use offline local-path fixtures (no network) so they are
safe to run in CI without tokens.
